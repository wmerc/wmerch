      <h4>Hey there!</h4>
      <p>
        I'm Will, a seasoned product designer with over a decade of experience.
        I am passionate about creating intuitive, user-centered designs that
        solve real-world problems. My career has been dedicated to transforming
        complex ideas into accessible, beautiful, and functional products that
        delight users and drive business success.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects
        across different industries, which has given me a broad perspective and
        a versatile skill set. My design philosophy is rooted in empathy and
        innovation, always striving to understand the user's needs and pushing
        the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
